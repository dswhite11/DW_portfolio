##Project 1 - Bike-Share Data Analysis

I created this R Notebook as the capstone project to Google's Data Analytics Certificate course, hosted on Coursera. The purpose of the project was to analyze the data of a bike-share company in Chicago, and provide recommendations to the company's marketing team for their new ad campaign.

Applications used:
- SQL
- Excel

## [Project 1 - Reading Log Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/profile/david.white5299#!/vizhome/Books2020_16052071128230/Daves2020ReadingLog)

This project is a visualization of all the books I read in 2020. It is interactive, and allows the user to read my review of each book by selecting an icon on the chart at the top. Selecting an icon will also highlight the book's page count in the bar graph.

I used a web-scraping program based in R to scrape the GoodReads.com website for page numbers for all of the books. 

Applications used:
- Tableau
- Google Sheets
- R
