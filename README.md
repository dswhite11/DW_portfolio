I created this report from an R Notebook as the capstone project to Google's Data Analytics Certificate course, hosted on Coursera. The purpose of the project was to analyze the data of a bike-share company in Chicago, and provide recommendations to the company's marketing team for their new ad campaign.

The report is extremely detailed and shows nearly all the steps I took in the analysis process. It begins with uploading and manipulating the data in PostgreSQL and Excel, then moves to cleaning and reorganizing the data, and ends with visualizations created in RStudio and Tableau.

# [Project 2 - Reading Log Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/profile/david.white5299#!/vizhome/Books2020_16052071128230/Daves2020ReadingLog)

This project is a visualization of all the books I read in 2020. It is interactive, and allows the user to read my review of each book by selecting an icon on the chart at the top. Selecting an icon will also highlight the book's page count in the bar graph.

I used a web-scraping program based in R to scrape the GoodReads.com website for page numbers for all of the books. 

Applications used:

- Tableau
- Google Sheets
- RStudio

Languages used:

- R

# [Project 3 - Lakers Game Analysis](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dswhite11/portfolio/blob/d89e5016de149971961424d6e08a6c361dae2344/laker_project/lakers_markdown_intro.html)

A fun project using the built-in Lakers data from the Lubridate package. I practiced filtering and plotting with ggplot2 to analyze each Laker's performance in the first game of the season, against the Portland Trailblazers. The notebook goes through every step of my thinking process, so if it seems tedious and wordy, that's why.

Applications used:

- RStudio

Languages used:

- R
